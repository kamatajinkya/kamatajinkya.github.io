  I am a First Year Graduate Student at the Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. My main area of focus is prehensile manipulation and navigation; electronics and design of robotics manipulators, however, I have a keen interest in becoming a full stack roboticist. I have designed and deployed indigenously designed Industrial Robots. I have also worked on motion planning and perception for debris clearing robot as a part of Robotic Collaborative Technical Alliance.

  Previously, I was a Visiting Scientist at Paul G Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. I worked at the Personal Robotics Lab (PRL) with Prof. Siddhartha Srinivas. 

  I have a Bachelor's of Technology in Electronics and Telecommunication from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India (VNIT). At VNIT, I designed ReBiS a novel Snake Robot capable of Bipedal Locomotion as a part of my thesis. After graduating, I worked at Systemantics India Private Limited, where I was the primary electronics engineer. Here I designed and developed the electronics and firmware for Asystr600, including the motherboard for the main controller as well as motor drivers for the joints. At PRL, I mainly work on Roman, a Bimanual tracked mobile robot developed at Jet Propulsion Lab and General Dynamics. My other contributions to the Lab, involve helping the Lab develop Aikido, a c++ library for robotic motion planning and decision making. I am also working on developing a robot capable of manipulation food using chopsticks for assistive feeding.

          - odernized System Architecture by executing a move to ARMv8 based System Controller; assisted in identifying platform by performing performance tests; developed using ROS2 framework increasing modularity and extensibility
          - Optimized Linux preempt-rt kernel-based OS for System-Level Controller achieving a latency of less than 10uS
          - Established a streamlined development/deployment pipeline based on git, docker, and apt enabling reliable over-the-air updates and improving operational efficiency
          - Conceptualized object-oriented architecture for Dual Motor Controller firmware, utilizing FreeRTOS to guarantee real-time performance, resulting in portable and safety-critical code

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
